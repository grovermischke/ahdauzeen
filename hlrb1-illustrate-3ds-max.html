Between huge bugs, game design flaws and flopped events, we are always in a constant expectation of underwhelming attitudes from the company. There are many reasons to compliment some of their attitudes in the past year. We have seen solid feedback to community requests, implementation of new content like weather, quests, friendship and trade. This is not something I am overlooking while making this post. NB: I posted this yesterday with lots of inline images, but I don't think Reddit liked that. Clicking on a character's name will bring up an Imgur album. I've saved the inline image version for Tumblr (https://gofancyninjaworld.tumblr.com/post/174948317257/bullseye)  This is still a long post, but the sections are independent and may be read in any order. # Introduction In One-Punch Man, Murata illustrates a variety of fighting styles. Inspired by a discussion a couple of months. My game uses a custom 3D engine. Our engine uses a certain naming convention for materials to pick up special in-game attributes. For example material COMBINEBASE01 will have a certain in-game color blending effect in addition to the texture itself. Another part the object might have material COMBINETOP01 or COMBINESIDE01 both assigned the same file. The problem is that Substance Painter creates a texture set for each material name. So, as I described above, in Max I may have a single texture. NOTE --- There is a TLDR at the end, as this is a long post. So you can check out the pretty graphs and skip if you don't have time for the detail. Album is here: https://imgur.com/a/k2loz35 I constantly see comments flying around on tech articles and even here about not being able to game on Threadripper, or rather, that it was substantially slower than mainstream siblings (1800x, etc). This narrative always intrigued me, as I seemed to have noticed an uptick 
So you plan on spending a lot of time playing BFV multiplayer and you want to get an idea about what kind of gear is going to give you near top level performance? No problem, I got you.

EDIT: TO everyone waiting on pictures- I'm sorry, I had a thermo exam yesterday that I spent the last week desperately procrastinating for (including making this writeup) so I couldn't od it then- i'll put it up today Heyo guys, so for a long time I've been preoccupied with the question of how to efficiently map dungeons in three dimensions on 2D paper. This isn't a full answer to that question, but here's a quick method of demarcation I've devised & adopted- I'm curious ###^^(Continued.) >Kevin: >-How long does it take on average for a change to a class to be approved? >-What kind of Class- and spellideas did you scrap? > >John: >-What kind of Raid- and Dungeonideas did you scrap? >-Were there more Raids planned to be accesible to dungeons? > >To all: >-What is the stupidest workaround you ever found to an issue? >-What was the riskiest idea you ever implemented into the game? (As in you were not sure how well it would. ###^^(Continued.) > ( found this image of an area in Elwynn Forest, that I am not able to recognize from the released game.I have heard before that Elwynn and Westfall were some of the earliest zones made, and was wonderingwhether the entire Elwynn Forest was remade since this image was taken. > > >Also I am unsure of where or who to go to for help for this. I want to so badly go into the Game Design Industry. I want to write, illustrate, and create the worlds and characters in video games. Story telling is a huge passion of mine and is the closest thing to a purpose I have. The issue: I live in Southwest Missouri. There is no creative opportunity here for anything. There no school that offers anything remotely close to game development, working with game engines, 3D Max, Maya, etc. Besides. Trail of Cold Steel shot itself up from a 8/10 to a 9.5/10 out of purely its last 20 hours alone. Here's my piece on Trail of Cold Steel, I won't go into much specific details much so while this critique/review/afterthoughts is non-spoiler thanks to it, if you haven't played the game you probably would be confused at some parts and ultimately, not garner much from this post. I doubt anyone in this subreddit hasn't played this game though. Constructive criticisms are more than welcomed, I'm curre. Hey guys, never read this before on TSR so i will give you a biref summary of my ideas. Have to write this fast, because i have to go to work in 20 minutes. sorry for bad english or formatting, i am a reddit newb. We know - the activation range of Pokestops is different at different places on earth (only latitude dependent). - google maps, open street maps and a lot of other Map services are using the mercator projection - mercator projection does not illustrate the Areas(=lengths) Hi folks and welcome to the anarcho-transhumanist AMA. The term "anarcho-transhumanism" is a relatively recently one, barely mentioned in the 80s, publicly adopted in the early oughts and only really popularized in the last half decade. But it represents a current of thought that has been present in anarchist circles and theory since William Godwin, who tied the drive to perpetually improve and perfect ourselves with the drive to perpetually improve and perfect our social relations. 
Or anything else for that matter. First off no disrespect to the hard work the devs are putting in, if I was a dev then maybe I could practise what I preach. However, in many of the demos / games I've tried I feel like stuff doesn't look as big as it should. And I think this is why: I've also noticed that stuff that by all accounts should be way too distant for our ability to perceive stereo depth is rendered in such a way that you can. The max distance human vision can perceive I've read lots of other reviews but many of them don't speak to me. Here's what I am: married with a modest house, 40 (meaning: sleep matters), and super, super, super busy at work. Super busy means "I think there may be knobs for this but I've not had time to look" and many other things. This isn't going to be super organized. Maybe other married-or-busy-at-work types will appreciate this. I have gotten so much out of this subreddit that I thought I'd give something back. I think setup.

So everyone has been woundering how staff morale works and what the hell those lil medals they get mean as well. Im here to try and answer those questions and hopefully give you some good knowledge on how you can effecitvly increase your staffs ranks with little time. TL;DR Not worth the hassel and effort, Morale as of now feels unfinished due to some overlooked mechanics and how your suppose to increase it. Theyres not much benifit except you wont lose anyone Hi guys ! I've been involved in the hobby for a few months now. I bought a second-hand racer in december (fake fiberglass Martian 2 frame, Naze32 Rev5 and V-Spec 2205s with Little Bee 20A Pro ESCs) it flew okay but I knew i needed to upgrade some parts. Fast forward to now and this is my new build : SPF3 Neo with OSD piggyback V-Spec 2205 2350KV (same motors) 20A Little Bee Esc (same ESCs) HS1177 Eachine vtx Fs-a8s (connected via PPM) Slapped all this on a "new" ZMR250. Felipe (HarvesteR): Work on the fairings is nearing completion now. The procedural mesh generation is working pretty well, and fairings now also implement the same CargoBay module used in the cargo bay parts to handle shielding the payload inside. Payload handling itself was rewritten (just today in fact) to prevent cases where multiple cargo bays would enclose the same part. This is an expected case, the most easily explained version being a ship where a small bay is nested inside a larger. tl;dr: how to fix extruder temp issues that lead to fat corners on prints? I got my Maker Select last March, a few weeks before the v2 was announced. I gave up on it late last June due to print issues that appeared. Since then I've tinkered with it a few times, only to determine that the issues are definitely extruder related. I've done all the usual mods: Z braces Thumbwheels DiiiCooler in PETG Borosilicate glass bed 40 tooth extruder gear MicroSwiss all metal Installation.
